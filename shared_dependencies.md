Shared Dependencies:

1. `Database Connection`: The `Database_Connect.php` file in the `Config` directory is shared among all the PHP files in the `Controllers` and `Models` directories. It provides the necessary connection to the database.

2. `User Data Schema`: The `User_Model.php` file in the `Models` directory defines the user data schema, which is used by `User_Controller.php` and `User_View.php`.

3. `Schedule Data Schema`: The `Schedule_Model.php` file in the `Models` directory defines the schedule data schema, which is used by `Schedule_Controller.php` and `Schedule_View.php`.

4. `Shift Data Schema`: The `Shift_Model.php` file in the `Models` directory defines the shift data schema, which is used by `Shift_Controller.php` and `Shift_View.php`.

5. `DOM Element IDs`: The `index.html` file in the `Public` directory defines the DOM elements that the JavaScript files (`Main.js` and `Helpers.js`) interact with. These IDs include `#userForm`, `#scheduleForm`, and `#shiftForm`.

6. `CSS Classes`: The `Main.css` and `Theme.css` files in the `Public/Assets/CSS` directory define the CSS classes that are used in the `index.html` file and manipulated by the JavaScript files.

7. `Image Files`: The `Logo.png` and `Background.jpg` files in the `Public/Assets/Images` directory are used in the `index.html` file.

8. `Third-Party Libraries`: The `Third_Party_Library_1` and `Third_Party_Library_2` in the `Vendor` directory are used across various PHP and JavaScript files for additional functionalities.

9. `Composer Dependencies`: The `composer.json` file in the root directory defines the PHP dependencies that are used across various PHP files in the `Controllers` and `Models` directories.

10. `Function Names`: Functions defined in `Main.js` and `Helpers.js` are used across the `index.html` file and potentially within each other. These might include functions like `initApp()`, `submitUserForm()`, `submitScheduleForm()`, and `submitShiftForm()`.

11. `Message Names`: Certain standard message names might be used across the `Controllers` and `Views` for user feedback, such as `SUCCESS`, `ERROR`, `INVALID_INPUT`, etc.
