Since the file type for `Vendor/Third_Party_Library_1` is not specified, I'll assume it's a JavaScript library. Here's a simple example of a JavaScript library that provides a utility function:

```javascript
(function(global) {
    'use strict';

    var ThirdPartyLibrary1 = {};

    ThirdPartyLibrary1.utilityFunction = function(param) {
        // Implement the function logic here
        console.log('Utility function called with param: ' + param);
    };

    if (global.ThirdPartyLibrary1) {
        throw new Error('ThirdPartyLibrary1 is already defined in the global scope');
    } else {
        global.ThirdPartyLibrary1 = ThirdPartyLibrary1;
    }
})(this);
```
