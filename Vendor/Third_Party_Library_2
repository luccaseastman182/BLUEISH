Since the file type and the specific third-party library are not specified, I'll assume it's a JavaScript library. Here's a basic structure for a JavaScript library:

```javascript
(function(global) {
    'use strict';

    var ThirdPartyLibrary2 = {};

    ThirdPartyLibrary2.someFunction = function() {
        // Functionality here
    };

    ThirdPartyLibrary2.anotherFunction = function() {
        // Functionality here
    };

    // Expose the library to the global object
    if (typeof module !== 'undefined' && module.exports) {
        module.exports = ThirdPartyLibrary2;
    } else {
        global.ThirdPartyLibrary2 = ThirdPartyLibrary2;
    }

})(this);
```
